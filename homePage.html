                    At Vrikshah, the team is optimistic that planet earth will be as good to us 
                    as we are to it and the society will be as good a place to live in as we 
                    make it. Imagine a world where everyone has clean air to breathe, has food 
                    to eat, has clean water to drink and sanitation facilities to use, has 
                    access to affordable healthcare and education, has equal opportunities, 
                    has human rights. In essence, imagine a world where everyone has the basics 
                    to live a dignified life. Only by brining change at grassroots, the 17 
                    sustainable development goals, as outlined by the United Nations can be 
                    achieved. To create long term impact, it is important to plant the seeds 
                    of sustainable life and good practices in institutions that already exist. 
                    The Foundation is committed to creating a more equal and sustainable planet 
                    earth by institutionalising sustainable practices.

                    V.F’s concerns are global but its work begins at the grassroots. With a goal

                    schools, Vrikshah aims to embed good practices in already existing institutions 
                    like schools, self-help groups, panchayats, at the outset. The Foundation wants 
                    to achieve maximum change, minimum intervention and will create mechanisms that 
                    supplement the government run initiatives. Vrikshah aims to increase its 
                    footprint yet decrease it dependency so these structures runs smoothly even 
                    when the organisation is plugged out. Backed by a dedicated team which strongly 
                    believes in an equitable society for all and is impatient to deliver change, 
                    the organisation will collaborate with other NGOs, teachers, foundations,

                    <img src = "assets/images/KomalPic.jpg" class="w-25 img-responsive float-left"> I moved back after having an education in business and marketing from 
                    California, United States. When I returned it was Diwali a major Indian 
                    Festival, I realised it was so polluted that I actually forgot I was born 
                    in this country, there was a huge difference between the air quality of USA 
                    and India. For the first few months I cribbed about moving back to India and 
                    regretting my decision, but then one fine day I visited a village where my 
                    mother served as a government school teacher. I met the people in that village, 
                    spoke to them about their issues and I realised the grassroot people were 
                    willing to work and create a change and that day the seed was planted in my 
                    head of doing something with these people. In terms of environmental pollution 
                    and degradation the villagers are the people who have the least footprint but 
                    still they are the most willing to change and they eagerly agreed to host a 
                    tree plantation drive in there village, we planted 200 trees and the enthusiasm 
                    was spectacular, not only they participated but they took care of the trees for 
                    an year by providing it with water and proper care and that’s how our journey 
                    began.<br>
                    What’s the use of a foreign education and international exposure when you 
                    cannot put it in use for  society’s good. After that day the journey has been 
                    tough but a very beautiful one indeed, I met amazing people who were genuinely 
                    helping and since then we have planted 4000 trees in Delhi and NCR. We have 
                    helped women and children in two communities, we are taking it slow but our 
                    work has been focusing on quality rather than quantity. Our Goal now is to 
                    have a planned progress by tracking growth with data and taking help of other 
                    agencies who have potential data for our help in the field of climate change 
                    and do a research based plantation. Also, our focus is to progress in the 
                    grassroot masses specially with women and children to develop life skills by 
                    hosting special skilled workshops for them.<br> 
                    Komal has worked with Tata Trust as a  government consultant in collaboration 
                    with central Ministry of drinking water and sanitation, Govt of India where
